People-Change or People's Choice...?
============

Project for online community trade center. This is a idea I had for a few months now.
I need to create an online community store where people can buy and sell goods to each
other. The community is going to be the main focus.

update: February 5th 2015 - 

I am still exploring the technology that will create the project, leaning towards Angular JS. 

update: April 11th 2015

We started building the project Monday. We will use the MVC .Net Framework. There will be six people on the team. The project will be a four day Hackathon.  We plan on keeping this portion of the project opensource, so that people can add to the functionality.The group will build the crypto currency Shopping cart on the .Net Framework using the SQL database. The technology will be Angular JS, C#, JSON, XML, Web APIS for example crypto currency Api on the MVC Framework. We have a hosting account on BizSpark called PeopleChange the url will be bitmainstreet.com after the project is complete. The first phase will only focus on the crypto currency Shopping cart. Monday we will begin the wire-framing stage of the development process.
