People-Change or People's Choice...?
============

Project for online community trade center. This is a idea I had for a few months now.
I need to create an online community store where people can buy and sell goods to each
other. The community is going to be the main focus.

I am still exploring the technology that will create the project, leaning towards Angular JS.

Final got a team together. We start building the project Monday. We will use the MVC .Net Framweork. There will be six people on the team.

The technology will be Angular JS, C#, JSON, XML, Web APIS for example crypto currency Api on the MVC Framework. We have a hosting account on BizSpark called PeopleChange the url will be bitmainstreet.com after the project is complete. The first phase will only focus on the crypto currency Shoppings cart.
